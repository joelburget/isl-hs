-- | A local space is essentially a space with zero or more existentially
-- quantified variables. The local space of various objects can be obtained
-- using the following functions.
data LocalSpace

-- | Whenever a new set, relation or similar object is created from scratch,
-- the space in which it lives needs to be specified using an isl_space. Each
-- space involves zero or more parameters and zero, one or two tuples of set or
-- input/output dimensions. The parameters and dimensions are identified by an
-- isl_dim_type and a position. The type isl_dim_param refers to parameters,
-- the type isl_dim_set refers to set dimensions (for spaces with a single
-- tuple of dimensions) and the types isl_dim_in and isl_dim_out refer to input
-- and output dimensions (for spaces with two tuples of dimensions).  Local
-- spaces (see ยง1.4.9) also contain dimensions of type isl_dim_div.  Note that
-- parameters are only identified by their position within a given object.
-- Across different objects, parameters are (usually) identified by their names
-- or identifiers. Only unnamed parameters are identified by their positions
-- across objects. The use of unnamed parameters is discouraged.
data Space

-- | An affine constraint.
data Constraint

-- | Identifiers are used to identify both individual dimensions and tuples of
-- dimensions.  They consist of an optional name and an optional user pointer.
-- The name and the user pointer cannot both be NULL, however. Identifiers with
-- the same name but different pointer values are considered to be distinct.
-- Similarly, identifiers with different names but the same pointer value are
-- also considered to be distinct. Equal identifiers are represented using the
-- same object. Pairs of identifiers can therefore be tested for equality using
-- the == operator. Identifiers can be constructed, copied, freed, inspected
-- and printed using the following functions.
